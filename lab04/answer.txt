1.add t1, s0, x0 is just copying the value int s0 to t1, but we want to get the content at that address. 
2.Since the array in each node is of int type, the offset must be four bytes.
3.jalr s1 did not store the return address to ra.
4.The values in t0, t1 may be modified by the callee, we must spill them onto stack.
5.lw a1, 0(s1) is incorrect, since the address of that function is exactly in s1.
